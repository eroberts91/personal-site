Education
======
* M.S. in Biomedical Engineering, Drexel University, 2016
* B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, University of Delaware, 2014

Experience
======
* Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp: University of Pennsylvania 
  * A 24-week intensive coding program focused on Python, Machine Learning, Big Data, Tableau, VBA, Javascript, SQLPostgres/Mongodb database management and Microsoft Excel

*  Research Specialist C: University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine
  * Worked under Dr. Dave Schultz in the High Throughput Screening Core at the University of Pennsylvania running assays for virus and cancer drug research.
  * Maintained cell lines, ran assays and performed data analysis while managing an accelerated weekly viral assay testing pipeline.

* Research Specialist B: University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine
  * Interacted directly with collaborators of I.T.M.A.T. Bio-mechanics Core services, to organize orders for both existing services as well as newly developed services.
  * Lead researcher for new service adaptation including: atomic force microscopy-based mechanical testing, cell-embedded 3D biodegradable hydrogels, cellular traction force microscopy, and pressure myography mechanical testing.
  * Developed and tested new protocols for self-driven experiments as well as adoption by other researchers.
