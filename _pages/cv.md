* Research Specialist C: University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine
  * Helped to identify several drugs for further research in different virus treatments from a several tens-of-thousands drug library.
  * Maintained cell lines, ran assays and performed data analysis and presentation while managing an accelerated weekly viral assay testing pipeline.
  * Worked under Dr. Dave Schultz in the High Throughput Screening Core at the University of Pennsylvania running assays for virus and cancer drug research.

* Research Specialist B: University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine
  * Developed and tested new protocols for self-driven experiments as well as adoption by other researchers in pressure myography and hydrogel-based cell culture assays.
  * Interacted directly with collaborators of Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics(ITMAT) Bio-mechanics Core services, to organize orders for both existing services as well as newly developed services.
  * Lead researcher for new service adaptation including: atomic force microscopy-based mechanical testing, cell-embedded 3D biodegradable hydrogels, cellular traction force microscopy, and pressure myography mechanical testing.
