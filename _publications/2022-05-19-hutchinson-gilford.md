Children with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) suffer from multiple cardiovascular pathologies due to the expression of progerin, a mutant form of the nuclear envelope protein Lamin A. Progerin expression has a dramatic effect on arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and results in decreased viability and increased arterial stiffness. However, very little is known about how progerin affects SMC contractility. Here, we studied the LaminAG609G/G609G mouse model of HGPS and found reduced arterial contractility at an early age that correlates with a decrease in smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) mRNA and protein expression. Traction force microscopy on isolated SMCs from these mice revealed reduced force generation compared to wild-type controls; this effect was phenocopied by depletion of SM-MHC in WT SMCs and overcome by ectopic expression of SM-MHC in HGPS SMCs. Arterial SM-MHC levels are also reduced with age in wild-type mice and humans, suggesting a common defect in arterial contractility in HGPS and normal aging.
