Metabolic syndrome, today affecting more than 20% of the US population, is a group of 5 conditions that often coexist
and that strongly predispose to cardiovascular disease. How these conditions are linked mechanistically remains unclear,
especially two of these: obesity and elevated blood pressure. Here, we show that high fat consumption in mice leads to
the accumulation of lipid droplets in endothelial cells throughout the organism and that lipid droplet accumulation in
endothelium suppresses endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), reduces NO production, elevates blood pressure, and
accelerates atherosclerosis. Mechanistically, the accumulation of lipid droplets destabilizes eNOS mRNA and activates an
endothelial inflammatory signaling cascade that suppresses eNOS and NO production. Pharmacological prevention of lipid
droplet formation reverses the suppression of NO production in cell culture and in vivo and blunts blood pressure elevation
in response to a high-fat diet. These results highlight lipid droplets as a critical and unappreciated component of endothelial cell biology, explain how lipids increase blood pressure acutely, and provide a mechanistic account for the epidemiological link between obesity and elevated blood pressure.
