Background: Aortic dissection and aneurysm are the result of altered biomechanical forces
associated with structural weakening of the aortic wall caused by genetic or acquired factors. Current
guidelines recommend replacement of the ascending aorta when the diameter is >5.5 cm in tricuspid
aortic valve patients. Aortopathies are associated with altered wall stress and stiffness as well as
endothelial cell dysfunction and synthetic vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype. We
reported that these mechanisms are mediated by glycoxidation products [Reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and Advance Glycation End products (AGE)]. This study addresses the role of glycoxidation
on endothelial function and AGE-mediated aortic stiffness.
Hypothesis and aims: Here we investigate how circulating glycation products infiltrate the aortic
wall via AGE-mediated endothelial hyperpermeability and contribute to both VSMC synthetic
phenotype and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in vivo and ex vivo. We also study how
RAGE antagonist peptide (RAP) can rescue the effect of AGEs in vitro and in vivo in eNOS-/- vs WT
mice.
Methods and results: Human ascending aortas (n=30) were analyzed for AGE, ROS, and ECM
markers. In vitro glycation was obtained by treating VSMC or human and murine aortas with
glyoxal. Endothelial permeability was measured under glycation treatment. Vascular stiffness was
measured by a pressure myograph comparing wild-type mice ± glyoxal. eNOS-/- mice, a model of
increased endothelial permeability, were treated for 28 days with hyperlipidemic diet ± Angiotensin
II (1000ng/kg/min) with or without anti-glycation treatment (RAP 20mg/kg). Echo data of aortic
diameter were collected. Murine vascular stiffness was measured by a pressure myograph
(n=5/group). Glycoxidation products were detected in all human aortas independently of aortic
diameter, with stronger accumulation on the lumen and the adventitia layer. AGEs increased
endothelial permeability, induce synthetic phenotypic switch in human VSMCs, and inhibit cell
migration. RAP pre-treatment rescue the effect of glyoxal on endothelial cells. Ex vivo glycation
treatment of murine arteries impacted on ECM and increased stiffness. Aortic stiffness was higher in
perpetuity. It is made available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

eNOS-/- vs WT mice. Ang II-mediated aortopathies results in aortic dilation, and AGE/ROS
accumulation, which is rescued by RAGE antagonist peptide treatment of eNOS-/- mice.
Conclusions: Glycoxidation reaction mediate EC permeability, VSMCs phenotype, and ECM
remodeling leading to dysfunctional microstructure of the ascending aorta, altered vascular stiffness
and increasing aortic susceptibility to dilation and rupture. Moreover, we show that RAP can
mitigate AGE-mediated endothelial hyper-permeability in vitro and impact on ascending aneurysm
in vivo
